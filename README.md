To configure the student-search-tests automation framework into an AWS CI/CD pipeline, and upload HTML reports to S3, follow these steps:

✅ Part 1: AWS CI/CD Pipeline for Playwright Tests
There are two common ways:

🔹 Option 1: AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild

student-search-tests/
├── buildspec.yml
├── playwright.config.ts
├── tests/
├── .env.dev / .env.stage
📄 buildspec.yml (for AWS CodeBuild)

version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 18
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies
      - npm install
      - npx playwright install

  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Setting ENV variables
      - export ENV=dev  # or ENV=stage
      - cp .env.$ENV .env  # Optionally rename for default access

  build:
    commands:
      - echo Running Playwright tests
      - npx playwright test || true  # don't fail here so we can always generate report
      - echo Generating HTML report
      - npx playwright show-report --output=playwright-report

  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Uploading report to S3
      - aws s3 cp playwright-report s3://your-s3-bucket-name/reports/$ENV/ --recursive

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  discard-paths: no


✅ Steps to Set Up in AWS Console
✅ Go to AWS CodePipeline

✅ Create a pipeline:

Source: GitHub / CodeCommit

Build: AWS CodeBuild

✅ In CodeBuild:

Runtime: Ubuntu / Amazon Linux

Environment: Managed image with Node.js

Use this repo with buildspec.yml

✅ Set AWS IAM permissions to allow s3:PutObject to the report bucket.

✅ 

Part 2: Send & Store HTML Report to AWS S3
🧪 Already handled by this command in buildspec.yml:

aws s3 cp playwright-report s3://your-s3-bucket-name/reports/$ENV/ --recursive
This uploads all HTML assets in the playwright-report/ directory

You can browse it in the S3 console or serve it via static website hosting

🌐 (Optional) Enable S3 Static Site to View Reports
Go to your S3 bucket → Properties

Enable Static website hosting

Set:

Index document: index.html

Error document: index.html

Access reports via:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://your-s3-bucket-name.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com/reports/dev/
✅ IAM Permissions Required for S3 Upload

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}
🚀 Summary
Step	Tool	Description
1	CodePipeline + CodeBuild	Runs tests in AWS
2	buildspec.yml	Manages install, test, report upload
3	S3	Stores and hosts HTML reports
4	Optional	Send Slack/email notifications via Playwright teardown

Would you like a working buildspec.yml for both dev and stage environments with Slack report link post?

Where should i put this code -

  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [

    "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket-name/*"

You should add that code snippet as a policy statement to the IAM role used by your AWS CodeBuild project. Here's how to do it step-by-step:

✅ Where to Put This Code
🔒 This code defines permissions for accessing S3, and it goes into the IAM Role attached to AWS CodeBuild.

🧭 Step-by-Step: Add S3 Permissions to CodeBuild Role
1. Go to IAM Console
AWS Console → Search for IAM (Identity and Access Management)

2. Find the CodeBuild Role
Go to Roles on the left sidebar

Search for a role that starts with codebuild-<your-project-name> (e.g., codebuild-student-search-tests)

Click on the role

3. Attach an Inline Policy or Edit Permissions
Option A (recommended): Click "Add permissions" → "Create inline policy"

Option B: Click "Permissions" → Find policy → "Edit JSON"

4. Switch to JSON Tab and Paste the Policy
Replace your-s3-bucket-name with your actual bucket name:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::student-search-test-report",
        "arn:aws:s3:::student-search-test-report/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
5. Review and Save
Click Review Policy

Give it a name like S3ReportUploadPolicy

Click Create Policy

🎯 What This Enables
This allows the CodeBuild project to:

✅ Upload Playwright test reports to your S3 bucket

✅ Read/verify those files (optional if you want test to validate upload)

✅ List files in the bucket

Would you like me to generate a downloadable IAM policy JSON file or walk through setting up S3 static hosting to view the reports online?

Certainly! Here's a complete walkthrough to host Playwright HTML reports from your automation framework in an S3 bucket using AWS Static Website Hosting. This lets you view reports online via a public URL (like a mini dashboard).

✅ Step-by-Step: Host Playwright Reports Using S3 Static Website Hosting
🧾 Prerequisites
An S3 bucket (e.g., student-search-test-report)

Your Playwright HTML report (playwright-report/) uploaded to S3 (e.g., via CodeBuild or CLI)

Optional: a folder like /reports/dev/index.html in the bucket

📍 Step 1: Enable Static Website Hosting
Go to the S3 console

Select your bucket (e.g., student-search-test-report)

Go to the "Properties" tab

Scroll down to "Static website hosting"

Click Edit, then:

Enable it: ✅

Index document: index.html

(You can leave Error document empty or set index.html too)

Save changes

You’ll now see a static website URL like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://student-search-test-report.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
📁 Step 2: Upload HTML Report
Assuming your test generated a report at playwright-report/index.html, you can upload it manually or automate it:

Option A: Upload via AWS Console
Go to the "Objects" tab in your bucket

Click "Upload"

Drag-and-drop the playwright-report/ folder

Make sure files are uploaded into a prefix, like reports/dev/

Option B: Upload via CLI (automated)
bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp playwright-report/ s3://student-search-test-report/reports/dev/ --recursive
🔐 Step 3: Make Report Public (Permissions)
You need to allow public read access to view the report in browser.

Option A: Set Public Access Block to "Off"
In the bucket → Permissions tab

Scroll to Block public access

Click Edit

Uncheck:

"Block all public access"

Confirm and save

Option B: Use a Bucket Policy
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::student-search-test-report/*"
    }
  ]
}
Add this under the "Bucket Policy" section in the Permissions tab.

🌐 Step 4: Access the Report
Open the following URL in your browser:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://student-search-test-report.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/reports/dev/index.html
💡 If you're uploading for stage, change the path accordingly:
.../reports/stage/index.html

🚀 Bonus: Create Pretty URLs via Route 53 + CloudFront (Optional)
You can point a domain like reports.collegeboard-qa.com to the S3 static site using:

Amazon Route 53 for DNS

CloudFront to enable HTTPS and caching

Let me know if you'd like help with that setup too.

✅ Final Checklist
Task	Done?
Static hosting enabled	✅
Report uploaded (to index.html)	✅
Bucket policy allows public read	✅
URL accessible in browser	✅
